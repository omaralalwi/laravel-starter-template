    - Only one of these can be installed: illuminate/http[dev-master, v1.1.0, v1.1.1, v4.0.0-BETA2, ..., 4.2.x-dev, v5.0.0, ..., 5.8.x-dev, v6.0.0, ..., 6.x-dev, v7.0.0, ..., 7.x-dev, v8.0.0, ..., 8.x-dev, v9.0.0-beta.1, ..., 9.x-dev, v10.0.0, ..., 10.x-dev, v11.0.0, ..., 11.x-dev, 12.x-dev], laravel/framework[v11.0.0, ..., 11.x-dev]. laravel/framework replaces illuminate/http and thus cannot coexist with it.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
